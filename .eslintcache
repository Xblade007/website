I primarily code in Python and Ruby, but have lately\n    been using JavaScript (Node.js and React). For all of my projects, I also\n    document and write unit tests for my code.\n    <br />\n    <br /> Other than coding, I love to read, cook, create music, and spend time\n    with family. I grew up in Wilmington, Delaware and go to Davidson College.\n  </SupportingContentText>\n);\n\nexport default AboutPageContent;\n",{"ruleId":"100","replacedBy":"101"},{"ruleId":"102","replacedBy":"103"},{"ruleId":"104","severity":1,"message":"105","line":7,"column":8,"nodeType":"106","messageId":"107","endLine":7,"endColumn":13},{"ruleId":"104","severity":1,"message":"108","line":17,"column":9,"nodeType":"106","messageId":"107","endLine":17,"endColumn":35},{"ruleId":"104","severity":1,"message":"109","line":53,"column":10,"nodeType":"106","messageId":"107","endLine":53,"endColumn":15},{"ruleId":"104","severity":1,"message":"110","line":53,"column":17,"nodeType":"106","messageId":"107","endLine":53,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"104","severity":1,"message":"111","line":55,"column":12,"nodeType":"106","messageId":"107","endLine":55,"endColumn":26},{"ruleId":"104","severity":1,"message":"112","line":4,"column":8,"nodeType":"106","messageId":"107","endLine":4,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"100","replacedBy":"113"},{"ruleId":"102","replacedBy":"114"},{"ruleId":"104","severity":1,"message":"115","line":4,"column":7,"nodeType":"106","messageId":"107","endLine":4,"endColumn":15},{"ruleId":"116","severity":1,"message":"117","line":14,"column":5,"nodeType":"118","endLine":21,"endColumn":6},{"ruleId":"116","severity":1,"message":"117","line":25,"column":5,"nodeType":"118","endLine":32,"endColumn":6},{"ruleId":"116","severity":1,"message":"117","line":36,"column":5,"nodeType":"118","endLine":43,"endColumn":6},"no-native-reassign",["119"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["120"],"no-unused-vars","'Table' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","'ListGroupContentsPlaintext' is assigned a value but never used.","'color' is assigned a value but never used.","'setColor' is assigned a value but never used.","'formatContents' is defined but never used.","'Footer' is defined but never used.",["119"],["120"],"'Standout' is assigned a value but never used.","jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid","The href attribute is required for an anchor to be keyboard accessible.
